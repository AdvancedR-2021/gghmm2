\description{
The EM algorithm finds the maximum-likelihood estimates of a HMM.
}
\details{
Is an iterative method to find a local maximum likelihood or a maximum poosteriori estimates of parameters in a 
statistical model, where the model depends on hidden variables. The EM alternates between performing an expectation step, 
which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the curretn estimate for the parameters, 
and a maximation step, which computes the parameters, which maximize the expected log-likelihood found in the E step. This 
is then iterated.
