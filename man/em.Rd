\usage{
em(HM,X)
}
\arguments{
\item{HM}{A HMM object}

\item{X}{Data}

\item{tol}{tolerance of percentage change between likelihoods from different iterations}

\item{maxiter}{the maximum number of iteration the algorithm will run}
}
\value{
HMM Returns an updated HMM object
}
\description{
The EM algorithm finds the maximum-likelihood estimates of a HMM.
}
\details{
Is an iterative method to find a local maximum likelihood or a maximum poosteriori estimates of parametersin a 
statistical model, where the model depends on hidden variables. The EM alternates between performing an expectation step, 
which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the curretn estimate for the parameters, 
and a maximation step, which computes the parameters, which maximize the expected log-likelihood found in the E step. This 
is then iterated.
