## Objectives with the package

Package that can do HMM for us
- A class that contain parameters for the HMM
- EM
- Forward, Backward
- Decode, State prediction, Forecasting, etc.
- Visualization in the context of HMM
- Generating data from HMM
## Functions

-All the functions should work on the new class. 
- The Visualization of the HMM will need the user to provide the generation functions. 
-The same is true for Generating data from HMM

##  Forward, Backward
-Both take a numeric vector $X$ and a HMM class
- Both should output a matrix

## EM 
- The input is numeric vector $X$ , a HMM class and a tolerance level. 
- The output is the new parameters, which have been fitted to the data. 
- If times allow we would like the function to plot the new parameters as a mixed distribution against the data. 

##  local Decode
- The input is a numeric vector $X$ , a HMM class, a numeric value equal to a hidden states index $i$ and a positive numerical value which which is the time we will look at $t$. 
- The output is a numerical value of the prob. of the hidden state being equal to $i$ at time $t$. 

## State prediction
- The input is a numeric vector $X$ , a HMM class, a numeric value equal to a hidden states index $i$ and a positive numerical value which which is the time we will look at $t$. 
- The output is a numerical value which is equal to the prob of HMM having the hidden state $i$ at time $t$ in the future. 


## Forecasting
- The input is a numeric vector $X$ , a HMM class, a numeric value equal to a emission $a$ and a positive numerical value which which is the time we will look at $t$. 
- The output is a numerical value wich is eqaul to the prob of HMM emitting $a$ at time $t$ in the future.
